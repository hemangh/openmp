Recursive functional program test.

GNU compiler is behaving very badly. It really does not parallelize task based
compiles. I should try c/c++ version of the code to compare

ifort performs ok, but inconsistently. Can't determine if it is due to tasks
or the busy OS system at times. Basically 4 cores behave questionably on a Mac
with 4 cores maximum.

cores 	 time
  1       2.1      
  2       1.1 
  3       0.8 
  4       0.6-0.8 
  >       same as above
