Recursive functional program test.

GNU fortran compiler is behaving very badly. It really does not parallelize task based
compiles. I should try c/c++ version of the code to compare

for gcc compiler:
 cores     time
   1        4.3
   2        2.2
   3        1.7-2.2 
   4        1.1-1.7
   >        same or worse

ifort performs ok, but inconsistently. Can't determine if it is due to tasks
or the busy OS system at times. Basically 4 cores behave questionably on a Mac
with 4 cores maximum.
ifort compiler:
cores 	 time
  1       2.1      
  2       1.1 
  3       0.8 
  4       0.6-0.8 
  >       same as above
